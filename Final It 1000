    <h1>Welcome to my first web page!</h1>
    <p>My name is Jonathan Pierre York.  I am a sophomore at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  During my tenure at school 
    I've made countless friends and memories.  Also with studing what I would actually like to do in life, I would say I am having a
    great time.  The teachers here are really helpful in trying to have the best situation for their students.</p>

    <p>Even though I love my school I'm not sure if I want to continue after I graduate.  School itself is very drowning and time consuming.
    Sometimes with stuff you love, you can get tired of it.  I have been in school for 14 years.  That's a lot! But with time can come
    change. You never know what the future holds.</p>

    <h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
    <p>I come from a suburb in St. Louis named "**_University City_**".  I attended that school district all of my life. 
    If felt pretty good graduating from a place you've been at for so long.</p>
